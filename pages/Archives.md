    <label for="accordion2">Verification Regime</label>
    <div>
      <p>Member States are also required to declare any chemical weapons-related activities and industrial activities relating to the <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/controlled-chemicals" target="new">scheduled chemicals</a> and facilities producing unscheduled discrete organic chemicals.</p>
<p>The declarations are the basis for data monitoring and on-site <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/inspections" target="new">inspections</a> at the declared facilities. These inspections seek to verify that activities at the declared facilities are in accordance with the obligations of the Convention, and consistent with the submitted declarations. It is a confidence-building measure for ensuring that Member States meet the requirements of the Convention, and serves as deterrence against any intention to contravene the provisions of the Convention.</p>
